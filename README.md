A structured log of my daily LeetCode practice. Includes solutions, notes, patterns, and progress tracking for mastering DSA and problem-solving.


**Best Approach (Easiest):**

1. ✅ Save `TEMPLATE.md` in your repo
2. ✅ When you solve a problem:
   - Copy `TEMPLATE.md` 
   - Rename to `problems/[difficulty]/[number]_[name].md`
   - Fill it out (takes 5-10 mins)
3. ✅ Use VS Code snippets for faster creation
4. ✅ Optional: Ask me (Claude) or ChatGPT to help format your notes
